# Awesome notes

#### What is this about?

This repository is sort of a memento that I decided to create using Markdown and Git. The main idea is to document many things I use every day and I am afraid to forget its details constantly. I will additionally draft about my ideas and projects, the ideas that someone will be inspired and build them when I donâ€™t have the time, skills, or money to pull them off. This content (from the knowledge I gain) gives me (and of course you) a place to remember details. I'm sure you will find something you didn't know minutes ago at the least.

#### About me

I'm Ali Ben Messaoud, a very passionate and curious computer scientist and software engineer who is always looking into new technologies, patterns, methodologies, and ideas to develop my ever-growing toolkit and progress as a professional. Some non-programming things to know about me. I live in the Paris area, I am a coffee snob. In closing, I hope you enjoyed this visit and see you soon :]
