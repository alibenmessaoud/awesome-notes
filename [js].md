I have been developing web apps over a decade and have witnessed the rise and fall of many JavaScript libraries and frameworks. Change is inevitable on the web.

Haha.. jQuery JQuery (and associated libraries) was the de facto way to go about web development however, it has its limitations like plugins and its interferences. Then the rise in module driven development, etc. Then we saw the rise of web component specification that enabled capabilities to extend existing HTML elements. This inspired the era of component-based JS frameworks, including AngularJS and React with the lifecycle management model, etc and it was the battle between the watchers and the Virtual-DOM. Angular2.x soon emerged trying to fix the mess in the first version. VueJS came in the picture in 2014 and it was better in a few aspects where Angular or React lacks.

as 2020, Svelte / Stencil / Angular elements / Polymers / Web components are examples of this emerging trend.
