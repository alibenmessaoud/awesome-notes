I have been developing web apps over a decade and have witnessed the rise and fall of many JavaScript libraries and framework. Change is inevitable in the web.

Haha.. jQuery JQuery (and associated libraries) was the de facto way to go about web development however, it has its limitations like plugins and its interferences. Then the rise in module driven development (AMDs/requireJS/Dojo etc.)...  Web Component specification enables capabilities to extend existing HTML elements but this inspired the era of component-based JS frameworks, including AngularJS and React with the lifecycle management model, etc. In AngularJS, as the application size increased, many issues surfaced. It was not very performant when the number of components or watchers increase. ReactJS came up with improved change detection and update mechanism called Virtual-DOM which outperformed angular’s Scope and Watch techniques. Angular2.x soon emerged trying to fix the mess Angular 1 created however it was little late to do so as React had overtaken the defacto thrown by that time.  VueJS who are better in a few aspects where Angular or React lacks.

as 2020, Svelte / Stencil / Angular elements / Polymers / Web components are examples of this emerging trend.
