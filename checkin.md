### Check-in

As we adapt to what has been stamped "the new normal", long-standing habits have been redefined to fit present social restrictions. One well-known change is how we attend public spaces during these restrictions. Among these new limitations or habits, social distancing is encouraged by many governments. Social distancing is has been introduced to reduce the spread of infection and to avoid unnecessary social gatherings.

To help to ensure this purpose, the central idea of this app is to provide a service to get information on the crowd situation at stores. 

This helps the citizens to choose where and when to make their primary purchases and maintain safe social distancing, as they are less likely to visit very crowded stores or those that have reached maximum operating capacity. 

The store owners or any visitor person can create a place/ store on this app. The store owners can adjust the information like the maximum capacity. Visitors or the store can update the crowd by submitting the number of persons present at the entry or inside the store.
