## Def

**Agile** is a structured and iterative approach to project management. It provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the tracks. No one has the luxury to develop a product for years or even months in a black box.  

**Kanban** is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency(or flow). Kanban teams concentrate on decreasing the time it needs to make a  user story from start to finish. They do this by employing a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work. 

**Scrum** teams commit to shipping working software through set intervals called sprints. Their goal is to create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback. Scrum teams adopt specific roles, create special artifacts, and hold regular ceremonies to keep things moving forward. 

## Kanban vs. Scrum

Scrum and Kanban are both iterative work practices that rely on process flows and aim to reduce waste. But, there are a few main differences between the two.

|                                | Kanban                                                       | Scrum                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Roles and Responsibilities     | There are no pre-defined roles for a team. Although there may still be a Project Manager, the team is boosted to collaborate when any one person becomes confused. | Each team member has a predefined role, where the Scrum master dictates timelines, The Product owner establishes goals and team members do the work. |
| Due Dates / Delivery Timelines | Products are delivered continuously on an as-needed basis (with due dates defined by the business as needed). | Deliverables are defined by sprints in which a set of work must be finished and ready for review. |
| Delegation & Prioritization    | Uses a “pull system,” or a regular workflow that enables team members to only “pull” new tasks once the previous task is complete. | It also uses a “pull system” however a full batch is pulled for each iteration. |
| Modifications / Changes        | Allows for changes to be made to a project mid-stream, allowing for iterations and continuous improvement before the completion of a project. | Changes during the sprint are strongly discouraged.          |
| Measurement of Productivity    | Measures production using “cycle time,” or the amount of time it needs to finish one full piece of a project from beginning to end. | Measures production using velocity through sprints. Each sprint is laid out back-to-back and/or concurrently so that each additional sprint relies on the success of the one before it. |
| Best Applications              | Best for projects with widely-varying priorities.            | Best for teams with stable priorities that may not change as much over time. |

| Rhythm            |    Regular fixed length sprints (ie, 2 weeks)    |        Continuous flow        |
| Release           |            At the end of each sprint             |      Continuous delivery      |
| Roles             |  Product owner, scrum master, development team   |       No required roles       |
| Key metrics       |                     Velocity                     |  Lead time, cycle time, WIP   |
| Change philosophy | Teams should not make changes during the sprint. | Change can happen at any time |

In Scrum, all activities happen on the same cadence according to the project plan. Everyone agrees on a larger plan, which is split into smaller parts. The crew does the same set of activities in cycles made in a prescribed way. This is good at times, but if there is a delay, the whole project may come to a halt.

In Kanban, activities are not usually joined together in such a way. Scrum teams practicing Kanban as a visual management tool can get work achieved faster and more often. Prioritized jobs are finished first as the team collectively determines what is most suitable by using the visual tips from the Kanban board.

The most useful part is that Scrum teams can apply Kanban and Scrum at the same time. When regarding Kanban vs. Scrum, there are similarities, but there are several variations between Kanban and Scrum to consider as well.
