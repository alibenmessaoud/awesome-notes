Microservices is the most famous architecture style when talking business and shorter times to market. In fact, it speeds up adopting new business features by ensuring the change from the design, the development to the test, and the deployment of each service separately, without perturbing other features or services.

Before looking at the features of microservices architecture, let's see where it has come this architectural style. You'll say to replace the monolith. The Monolith.

> There's nothing wrong with the monolith, and a monolith with *some* cumbersome services living separately will work for most businesses out there, so it is not ugly or cursed or unattractive or any other bad word to describe it. Try to don't solve problems you don't have. Don't go straight to the microservices because this style is here for a reason.

Over the last decades, it was usual for companies to spend money on building applications for their business demands. Applications used to provide UI, business operations, access to databases and resources, etc., inside and outside their runtime. It was a classic thing. These apps, called the monolith, were and still build as a single unit and got deployed as a single executable binary, and always run on a single and isolated server.

Why microservices? 

Designing, developing, testing, fixing, and updating applications became difficult tasks when building applications and delivered the monolithic. 

Agile, small, and domain or service-focused are the most traits of microservices architecture. This helps build and change some parts of an application independently without side effects and conformity with evolving business needs.

Decomposing a monolith into autonomous microservices and using composition to offer the same business value has many benefits. With this style, it is easy to develop new features, understand, maintain the existing ones without side effects, and give us the power to deploy, scale, and run independent pieces of an application.

These days, it is always hard to pick an architectural style for a new project. Like any architectural style, microservices bring costs and benefits. There are many elements to consider before choosing microservices or monolithic because it is easy to get distracted by all the hype about new rising technologies.

Choose a monolithic architecture over microservices when the scope is small, the user base is limited to a specific class of people, and the business will not grow fast as the time to market is crucial. Also, small teams with either novice or intermediate is the right argument to take the monolithic first. Don't listen to the noise outside. Moreover, for low budget or sample infrastructure usage, this is another argument to pick the monolithic.

> In most practical use cases, a monolithic architecture would be enough. 

Unlike choosing a monolithic architecture, the decision here is more complex and may involve cross consideration: The size of the scope, the growing nature of the application and the business, and many users must be considered here. If the team is also large, and its members have good skills to do microservices or several technologies, and effectively develop individual components independently, think of the microservices architecture. It is important to consider that the microservice architecture will take more time to get to the surface.
