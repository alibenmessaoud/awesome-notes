### RDV

As we adapt to what has been stamped "the new normal", long-standing habits have been redefined to fit present social restrictions. One well-known change is how we attend public spaces during these restrictions. Among these new limitations or habits, social distancing is encouraged by many governments. Social distancing is has been introduced to reduce the spread of infection and to avoid unnecessary social gatherings.

To help to ensure this purpose, the central idea of this app is to provide a service to make an appointment. Stores or any on-site service can create a calendar on this app and set up slots for a specific number of visitors each day. So the visitors need to book a slot and must show up at the chosen time.

The app is composed of a back-office app for stores to manage calendars, hours, slots and visitors, and a public app for visitors to make and manage an appointment.
