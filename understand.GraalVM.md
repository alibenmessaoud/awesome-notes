It's good to have orchestrators managing containers so our applications can scale and heal. But one reason for them is also related to startup time: how fast can an orchestrator instantiate a container and start a new instance of a Java application? The answer is usually that, no matter how fast the orchestrator works, the JVM will always take long to startup. GraalVM is a technology that can shorten this startup time by building native images out of Java code.
