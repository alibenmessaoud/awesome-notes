## Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual

>  John Sonmez

It's not about showing you how to polish your technical skills but to provide a list of useful recommendations that can help your development life in multiple aspects.

#### Think about your goals

- Each action you take without a precise direction is a wasted action. Don't randomly walk through life without a goal for your career.
- Try to divide your big goals into smaller goals. The smaller goals keep you on track and motivated so that you keep heading in the direction of your bigger goals.

#### Climbing the corporate ladder

- Take responsibility: search is in areas that no one else wants to get involved in and try to contribute your talents to. Another way to indirectly take on responsibility is to become a mentor for others on your team.

- Be visible: All of your tasks can simply go to waste if you can't find a way to upper management know what you're doing.

- - Keep daily/weekly reports to your boss.
  - Offer to give presentations or pieces of training.
  - Speak up - do this at meetings.
  - Be seen - set up regular meetings with your boss.

#### Being professional

- A professional is someone who takes their responsibilities and career seriously and is ready to make the tough choices that have to be made. Set a high bar and stick to it, don't compromise for the shortcut.
- A real professional has high-quality standards for all areas.
- Find your gaps: anything you're doing repeatedly is worth a careful review to see if there's something you don't know that, if you did, you might work that side and increase your efficiency.

#### Learning - 10 steps

- Get the big picture
- Determine scope
- Define success
- Find Resource
- Create a learning plan
- Filter resources
- Learn enough to get started
- Play around
- Learn enough to do something useful (side projects)
- Teach !

#### Facing failure

- Don't be afraid to look like an idiot.
- Failure isn't the same thing as defeat. Failure is temporary, defeat is permanent. If you want to succeed, you have to learn how to control yourself and feelings and get out there and not be afraid to make a fool of yourself.
- You could have all the skills in life that should make you successful, but if you lack one important skill, determination, it will all be wasted, because, at the first sign of discomfort, you'll give up.

#### Productivity

- Run like a machine on a tight schedule every single day isn't something that can be kept in the long run (Personally as Ali, I tried it once and twice and I failed each time. I worked on two side projects at night in parallel with my full time job): Make sure that you have some time off, best to save it for family.

- Use the Pomodoro technique: set a timer for 40 minutes and work on the first task you've planned. You'll never unbreak focus but you have to finish the task. Pause for 5 minutes.

- Develop a sense of self-accountability to be productive. Without accountability, you're always dependent on external motivations to get you to perform.

- Get away from time wasters

- - Watching TV
  - Social media
  - Unnecessary meetings
  - Playing videogames

- Break down things

- - One of the main reasons for postponing tasks which is the bane of productivity is problem admiration: being so busy admiring the size of a problem that you don't try and solve it.
  - When faced with a large problem, don't think and take steps to solve the problem. By taking the first steps you'll have new information and a clear view to make a wise decision - **TAKE ACTION**.
